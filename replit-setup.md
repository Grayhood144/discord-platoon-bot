# Replit Setup Guide for Discord Bot

## Step 1: Environment Variables (Secrets)
1. In your Replit, click the **"Secrets"** icon in the left sidebar (looks like a lock üîí)
2. Click **"New Secret"**
3. Add your Discord bot token:
   - **Key**: `DISCORD_TOKEN`
   - **Value**: Your actual bot token (the long string from Discord Developer Portal)
4. Click **"Add Secret"**

## Step 2: Install Dependencies
1. In the **"Shell"** tab at the bottom, run:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Step 3: Run the Bot
1. Click the **"Run"** button at the top
2. Your bot should start and you'll see "‚úÖ Logged in as [Bot Name]" in the console

## Step 4: Keep It Running 24/7
Replit has a feature called **"Always On"** for paid plans, but for free:
- Your repl will stay active as long as you have it open in a browser tab
- You can use **UptimeRobot** (free) to ping your repl every 5 minutes to keep it alive

### UptimeRobot Setup (Free):
1. Go to [uptimerobot.com](https://uptimerobot.com)
2. Sign up for free account
3. Add a new monitor:
   - **Monitor Type**: HTTP(s)
   - **URL**: Your Replit URL (looks like `https://your-repl-name.your-username.repl.co`)
   - **Check Interval**: 5 minutes
4. This will ping your repl every 5 minutes to keep it alive

## Step 5: Check Your Bot is Working
1. Go to your Discord server
2. Try a command like `$help` or `$deploy`
3. Your bot should respond!

## Troubleshooting:
- **"Cannot find module"**: Run `npm install` in the shell
- **"Invalid token"**: Check your secret is named exactly `DISCORD_TOKEN`
- **Bot not responding**: Check the console for error messages

- ‚úÖ Free tier available
- ‚úÖ Built-in terminal and debugging

### Replit Cons:
- ‚ùå Free tier has limitations

- ‚ùå Less reliable than Railway

### Railway Pros:
- ‚úÖ More reliable 24/7 uptime
- ‚úÖ Better performance

## Recommendation:
Since you already have it on Replit, **start there first**! It's perfect for testing and development. If you find Replit's limitations annoying (like the sleeping issue), then move to Railway for better reliability.
